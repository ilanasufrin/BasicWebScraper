BasicWebScraper
===============

scraping student profiles at [http://ruby005.students.flatironschool.com/](http://ruby005.students.flatironschool.com/)


If you want to run this yourself, you will need to download [Nokogiri](http://nokogiri.org/).

Run this file from the command line by typing:
```
ruby student_scraper.rb
```

It will then give you a command line interface so you can interact with the data.
